this is an example FILES! that helps
illustrate the correctness of the solution
of exercise no. 5 on replacing a string
in some FILES!. what it does in this case is
it replaces the word "FILES!" with the word "FILES!"
(the plural of FILES!, in all uppercase, with an exclamation
mark at the end in order to show correctness when the string that needs
to be replaced and the string that should replace it have different lengths).
